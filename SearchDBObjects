##Note: I'm currently working on creating an advanced function for this, but in the meantime use the script below 

### Just return a list of stored procedure names and line numbers
### so that you know which line each definition begins on
$Directory = "<your directory here>";
$FileName = "AdventureWorks2014_StoredProcedureDefinitions_2018.rpt";
$FilePath = "$Directory\$FileName";
$Criteria1 = "CREATE PROCEDURE";

Set-Location $Directory;

Get-Content -LiteralPath "$FilePath" |
Select-String -Pattern $Criteria1 |
Select-Object -Property LineNumber, Line  |
Format-Table -AutoSize;

### Search for a column that you would like to examine in terms
### of its relationship to other stored procedures
$Directory = "<your directory here>";
$FileName = "AdventureWorks2014_StoredProcedureDefinitions_2018.rpt";
$FilePath = "$Directory\$FileName";
$Criteria1 = "CREATE PROCEDURE";
$Criteria2 = "businessentityid";

Get-Content -LiteralPath "$FilePath" |
Select-String -Pattern $Criteria1,$Criteria2 |
Select-Object -Property LineNumber,Line |
Format-Table -AutoSize;
